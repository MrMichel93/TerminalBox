=== TERMINAL CTF CHALLENGE ===
Welcome, hacker! Your mission is to find 5 hidden flags.

USEFUL COMMANDS:
- ls          : List files in current directory
- ls -la      : List ALL files (including hidden ones that start with .)
- cd <dir>    : Change to a directory
- cd ..       : Go up one directory
- pwd         : Show current directory path
- cat <file>  : Display contents of a file
- grep <text> : Search for text in files
- find        : Search for files

TIPS:
- Flags are labeled as: CTF{Flag #1: Description}
- Some files start with a dot (.) and are hidden
- Not all files named "flag" contain real flags
- Use 'grep -r "CTF"' to search recursively
- Explore deep into directories - some are nested far down

Good luck! Remember: real hackers are persistent!
