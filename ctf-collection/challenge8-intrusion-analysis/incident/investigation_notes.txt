INVESTIGATION NOTES
===================

INITIAL FINDINGS:
- Multiple failed brute force attempts on root and admin accounts
- Successful compromise of 'backup' account
- Privilege escalation to root via sudo
- Second access using SSH key (persistence mechanism)

EVIDENCE LOCATIONS:
1. logs/auth.log - Authentication logs showing the attack
2. .bash_history - Commands executed by attacker
3. suspicious_files/ - Files left by attacker (check hidden files!)

ANALYSIS TASKS:
1. Review auth.log for attack timeline
2. Examine bash history for attacker actions
3. Search for hidden files and directories
4. Look for encoded or obfuscated data
5. Check file permissions and timestamps

The flag is hidden somewhere in the evidence. 
Use your forensics skills to find it!
