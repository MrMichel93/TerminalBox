INCIDENT TIMELINE ANALYSIS
===========================

08:23:45 - Multiple failed SSH login attempts for root account from 192.168.1.100
08:24:12 - Failed login attempts switch to 'admin' account
08:24:45 - SUCCESSFUL login as 'backup' user from 192.168.1.100
08:25:01 - User 'backup' escalates to root using sudo
08:26:30 - Session disconnected
09:15:22 - Attacker returns using SSH key authentication
09:15:45 - Root commands executed to search for config files
09:16:12 - Session disconnected

QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE:
1. How did the attacker gain initial access?
2. What commands did they run?
3. What did they leave behind?
4. Where is the flag hidden?

HINT: Check the .bash_history file and look for hidden directories and encoded data.
